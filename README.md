This is our door opener app. It's a work in progress


## Push Notification ##

Push notifications for the application use the [Parse SDK](https://parse.com/). There is no client
SDK available in any Maven/Ivy repo and thus the SDK was included in the 'libs' folder.

To configure what API keys are used by the Parse SDK, rename the ``parse.properties.example`` file
to ``parse.properties`` and change the values as appropriate.
